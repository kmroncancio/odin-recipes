This is the odin-recipes project in The Odin Project Foundations course. The goal is to practice all of the command line, Git, GitHub, VSC and HTML skills that have been covered so far.

The end project will be a basic recipe website. It will look rather plain as we have not covered CSS yet. Agin, the goal is to just practice HTML. The website will have a main index page and a few links to recipes.
