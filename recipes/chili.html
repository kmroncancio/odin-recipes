      <h2>Best Homemade Chili Recipe</h2>
      <p>Homemade chili is delicious and goes great with cornbread or over corn chips for a chili pie! I like to use spicy pinto beans. But no chili is ever as good as Granny's.</p>
      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Beef: The recipe starts with a pound of ground beef. You can use ground turkey if you prefer.</li>

        <li>Canned goods: You'll need a can of tomato sauce, a can of stewed tomatoes, and a can of kidney beans.</li>
        <li>Spices: This homemade chili is spiced with chili powder, garlic powder, salt, and black pepper.</li>
      </ul>
